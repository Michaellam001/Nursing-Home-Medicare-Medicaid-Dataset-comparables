# Medicare Nursing Home Quality Analysis

📊 Project Overview
# Project Title: Analyzing Safety and Compliance Features in Nursing Home Facilities
This project analyzes data from Medicare and Medicaid-certified nursing homes in the United States. The focus is on identifying trends in deficiencies, penalties, staffing, ownership, and quality measures using a comprehensive dataset provided by Medicare.gov.
15,000 # Medicare and Medicaid-certified nursing homes in the country.

📌 Objectives
#To analyze the safety and compliance features in nursing home facilities and their potential impact on facility operations, 
# focusing on identifying key features related to safety and compliance.

📁 Dataset
The dataset was obtained from the official [Medicare.gov] (https://data.medicare.gov) website. It includes:
- Deficiencies
- Penalties
- Provider information
- Survey summaries
- Ownership types
- Quality metrics (MDS, MSR)
## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Jupiter Notebooks
- **Libraries**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Visualization**: Bar plots, heatmaps, scatter plots
- **Source Control**: Git & GitHub

🧠 Key Insights
- **For-profit nursing homes** had significantly more survey deficiencies than non-profit facilities.
- **Nursing homes with more staffing hours per resident per day** tended to have fewer penalties.
- **States with larger elderly populations** showed varied levels of quality care and deficiencies.
- **Ownership type** plays a major role in penalty occurrences and survey results.
📈 Visualizations
A set of charts are used to illustrate:
- Deficiencies by state
- Ownership type vs quality scores
- Penalty distributions
- Staffing comparisons

## ✅ Project Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization and storytelling
- Feature engineering (ownership groupings, staffing bins, etc.)
- Insights for healthcare stakeholders, patients, and policy analysts



## 📌 Future Work
- Predictive modeling of nursing home deficiencies
- Sentiment analysis on nursing home reviews (if available)
- Integration with CMS hospital-level data for cross-facility insights
